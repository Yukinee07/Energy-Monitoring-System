INFO 2304 System Analysis and Design, IIUM ‚Äì KICT

üåü Project Overview
The Energy Monitoring System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to monitor, analyze, and manage energy usage within an academic institution. This system is created with a focus on classroom environments in the Faculty of Information and Communication Technology (KICT), aiming to promote energy efficiency, reduce wastage, and support sustainability initiatives in line with SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy).

üö© The Problem
Despite the increasing need for sustainability, educational facilities face persistent challenges:
- Lack of real-time tools for tracking and managing energy use in classrooms and offices.
- Inefficient manual processes increase energy wastage and costs.
- No centralized system to benchmark, monitor, or optimize energy consumption patterns.
- Students, staff, and administrators lack clear visibility on usage responsibility and actionable feedback.

üí° The Solution
The Energy Monitoring System addresses these issues by:
- Providing real-time data on energy consumption at the venue and room level.
- Empowering administrators to control, enable, or disable systems/devices based on usage and occupancy.
- Delivering actionable analytics to benchmark consumption, encourage responsible use, and reduce costs.
- Enhancing user experience with responsive dashboards, reporting, and automated system toggling based on occupancy and administrative controls.

üîé Project Phases
1. Requirement Analysis
Problem identification using root cause analysis (Fishbone diagram, questionnaires).

Identification of user groups and major system requirements.

Stakeholder needs assessment.

2. System Modeling & Design
Creation of UML diagrams:
State Chart Diagram: Visualizes system state changes and logical flow.
Activity & Sequence Diagrams: Maps out user interactions, energy monitoring workflows, and maintenance procedures.
Class Diagram: Defines the system structure and object relationships.

Prototyping for all key interfaces and workflows using Figma and other tools.

3. Development (Prototyping Phase)
- Developed a multi-role system with dashboards for admins and staff.
- Implemented login, registration, feedback, and real-time dashboard modules.
- Built venue monitoring controls: systems can be enabled/disabled via central switching.
- User and admin dashboards highlight live energy use, notifications, and activity records.

4. Testing & Evaluation
User feedback collected on the prototype's usability, clarity, and effectiveness.
Technical validation of data flows, state transitions, and control features.

5. Documentation & Presentation
Comprehensive report compiling system diagrams, user interface explanations, and summary takeaways.
Presentation slides prepared to highlight project outcomes and learning points.

üñ•Ô∏è Final Output
- Interactive Web-Based Prototype:
  Includes modules for registration, login, dashboard visualization, maintenance, feedback, and administrative controls for classroom systems.

- Visualized State & Activity Diagrams:
  Clearly mapped user experience and logic flows for easy understanding and future development.

- Comprehensive Project Report:
  Compilation of problem analysis, system design, and reflection on sustainability goals achieved.

üöÄ Features Highlighted in the Prototype

User Registration/Login: Secure access for new/existing users.
Admin Dashboard: Real-time overview of user activity, energy usage, cost, and system status.
Venue Activity Controls: Admins can enable/disable systems in specific locations instantly to avoid wastage.
Consumption Analytics: Pie charts and graphs show active/inactive rates and trends.
System Toggle: Master ON/OFF switch for energy-critical venues.
Feedback & Maintenance Modules: Transparent communication and quick administrative response.

üèÜ Significance
This project establishes a scalable foundation for sustainable energy management in educational environments. By leveraging real-time monitoring, centralized control, and actionable analytics, it empowers all campus users to participate in responsible energy use, translating to cost savings and a reduced ecological footprint.
